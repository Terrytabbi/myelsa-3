                    <p>If only you knew how much those little moments with you matter to me. So far, every moment we've spent together has been awesome. But I promise you, that the best is yet to come. Your voice is my favorite sound.</p>
                    <p>Since the time I've met you, I cry a little less, laugh a little harder, and smile all the more, just because I have you, my life is a better place. Every day with you is a wonderful addition to my life's journey. You're my paradise, and I'd happily get stranded on you for a lifetime. Just when I think that it is impossible to love you any more than I already do, you prove me wrong.</p>
